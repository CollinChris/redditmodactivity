After testing bits of the code, the error is somewhere in the mod_activiti(mod) function(I renamed it activiti cause there were a lot of activity variables in the loop so I wanted to differentiate them for testing)
The issue is probably that the data isn't being added to the lists/dictionaries for some reason cause there's an error type None when checking the lists.
